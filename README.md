Two different solutions - one is very basic, easy solution. It takes around 15 - 20 minutes to load words that have >10 words in it's ladder (won't recognize no solutions)

Second solution utilises the Breadth-First Traversal in order to find the solution - very efficient, takes seconds to solve any word ladder puzzle and can recognize no solutions

Running the main methods creates a file with the solution, so if you are going to run it, make sure to delete the output file
